# Conference Configuration Verifier

This document describes the deterministic verifier we now use to keep conference `CellConfiguration`s honest in Binding.

## Why this exists

We repeatedly hit two classes of regressions:

- the `CellConfiguration` looked valid, but one or more `CellReference`s or action routes were broken at runtime
- the configuration contract was valid, but the renderer still failed to produce the expected conference surface

The verifier gives us two explicit layers:

1. `contract`
   - validates the configuration structure
   - resolves referenced cells
   - loads the configuration into `Porthole`
   - probes root keypaths
   - executes selected buttons/actions
   - records per-operation timing
2. `render`
   - renders the configuration in a real `NSHostingView`
   - waits for expected visible strings
   - records first meaningful content and total render time
   - fails if the expected surface never materializes

This is not a replacement for live staging auth/bridge debugging. It is a local regression net above the config/skeleton/runtime contract.

- Verifier core: [BindingTests.swift](/Users/kjetil/Build/Digipomps/HAVEN/Binding/BindingTests/BindingTests.swift)
- XCTest wrapper: [CellConfigurationVerifierXCTest.swift](/Users/kjetil/Build/Digipomps/HAVEN/Binding/BindingTests/CellConfigurationVerifierXCTest.swift)
- Runner script: [run_conference_configuration_verifier.sh](/Users/kjetil/Build/Digipomps/HAVEN/Binding/Scripts/run_conference_configuration_verifier.sh)

## What is covered now

Current conference surfaces:

- `Conference Participant Portal`
- `Conference Control Tower`

Current contract assertions:

- no validation errors from `CellConfigurationValidationService`
- all flattened `CellReference`s resolve
- all root probes are readable
- selected actions return `ok`

Current participant actions exercised:

- `Vis timeline`
- `Oppdater treff`
- `Oppdater discovery`
- `Start scanner`
- `Stop scanner`

Current organizer actions exercised:

- `Publish content`
- `Discard draft`

Current render assertions:

- `Conference Participant Portal`
  - expected strings include `Conference Participant Portal`, `Entity Discovery`, `Start scanner`
- `Conference Control Tower`
  - expected strings include `Conference Control Tower`, `Publish content`, `Operations & Insights`

## Commands

Run all contract checks:

```bash
./Scripts/run_conference_configuration_verifier.sh all contract
```

Run all render checks:

```bash
./Scripts/run_conference_configuration_verifier.sh all render
```

Run participant only:

```bash
./Scripts/run_conference_configuration_verifier.sh participant all
```

Run organizer only:

```bash
./Scripts/run_conference_configuration_verifier.sh admin all
```

## What worked in the latest green run

Latest verified on March 27, 2026:

- `./Scripts/run_conference_configuration_verifier.sh all contract`
  - 2 tests
  - 0 failures
  - total suite time about `15.95s`
- `./Scripts/run_conference_configuration_verifier.sh all render`
  - 2 tests
  - 0 failures
  - total suite time about `25.96s`

Per-test timings from that run:

- `Conference Control Tower` contract: about `13.21s`
- `Conference Participant Portal` contract: about `2.74s`
- `Conference Control Tower` render: about `21.24s`
- `Conference Participant Portal` render: about `4.72s`

These numbers are useful as a baseline, not as hard performance budgets yet.

## What the verifier already caught

The verifier forced us to fix several real issues:

- direct `dispatchAction` buttons with explicit `url` were not fully understood by the diagnostics validator
- organizer `Publish content` / `Discard draft` were routed through a weaker nested path and could produce `notFound`
- participant conference actions needed direct endpoint routing for deterministic verification
- render verification was too brittle when hosted through a temporary `NSWindow`
- long waits used to hang; now the verifier times out specific operations and reports them explicitly

## Known caveats

- The render verifier is currently macOS/AppKit-only.
- The test environment may still log local keychain noise like `-34018` and `missingMasterKey`; those logs do not currently fail the verifier when the surface itself resolves and renders correctly.
- A green verifier does not prove that staging is healthy. It proves that the local conference configuration, local fallbacks, local routing, and renderer contract are currently coherent.

## Recommended use

Before chasing a new conference regression in live GUI:

1. run the contract verifier
2. run the render verifier
3. only after that move to live staging/debug-panel/bridge tracing

That order keeps us from blaming staging for a broken local config, and it keeps us from blaming the config for a live auth or preview denial problem.
